#What is myRemote?
myRemote is a free and open source tool to connect you to all your devices from a simple webinterface, which you can access anywhere, anytime. Take screenshots of your desktop, execute a range of useful scripts we made for you, or create your own custom scripts if you want more freedom to do anything you want. 

#Security

Isn't controlling all my devices from a website really unsafe? Why should i trust you?

Controlling your devices over the web is always dangerous. Therefor myRemote uses a secure connection from client to server. This is also known as TLS, and it gets your traffic safely to the other side. 
To keep your account safe, we have a few built-in options, if you are logged into your account, you can see a logbook where you can see from which IP and location your account was used from. In case you see a different IP, we advise you to change your password.
We are also working to get a two-factor authentication system. This is still in alpha testing, but myremote.io will be updated soon.

#What do I need to use myRemote?
Two things:
- The myRemote client on the devices you want to be able to control. Supported OS'es are: Windows, OSX and Linux. Note that you will also need Python(2.7) to use the client.
- An account on myremote.io. Registration is currently not yet open, but you can request an invite code.

#How do I install the myRemote client?
- Log in to myremote.io and click the client download link.
- Click on "Generate key" in the myremote.io panel and copy the key to your paste buffer.
- Run "python myRemote.py" in a terminal (or command prompt in Windows).
- Paste the key you generated earlier and hit return. Your device is now registered with your account and the device will appear in the myremote.io panel.

#How do I use the myRemote.io panel?
Log in to the panel and see for yourself!
